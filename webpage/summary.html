<h2>Project Summary</h2>

Since the split we started our game from scratch. <br>
<br>
So we began with reimplementing what we already had before (<a href="../index.html">see weekly reports</a>) <br>
Then the idea was to create a kind of rogue-like platform survival game but first we had to finish some more basics we had not done yet <br>
<br>
<h3>Tiles</h3>
Since we did not yet do any work on visuals we started with creating three basic tiles <br>

<br>
and created a map editor for editing the underlying csv files ingame <br>

<h2>How to save/load the background and render it?</h2>
we used a 2dimensional list which countains all tileindexes, to save/load this list we use a csv-file<br>
based on the index of a tile we draw a tile at the given position of the tile on the screen so we render the background.<br>



<h2>Main Manu</h2>
....

<h2>Custom Background</h2>
We imlemented a map editor for editing the underlying csv files ingame<br>

<h2>Collision</h2>
<h4>How do we check for the collisions?</h4>
To do the collisions we have to create masks of all surfaces which we want to check the collision from
<h4>Tile Masks</h4>
To create a Mask for a tile, we need to create a transparent screen for each tile then we can place <br>
the tile on this transparent screen. After that we have to create a new suface of this screen, since we have this<br>
surface we can build a mask of it. when we build a mask, we give each pixel of this surface a 0,1 value, any traparent<br>
pixel will get 0 and the rest would get the 1.<br>
<h4>Robot Mask</h4>
To build a mask for the robot or projectile we just need to build the mask <br>
from its surface.<br>
<h4>Collision Check</h4>
To check for the collision we can check if there is an overlap between<br>
none transparent pixel of two masks. We can also check for the area of the collision so we know how many bits<br>
are colliding.<br>

<h4>Sea</h4>
We check a area for the collision of the robot with the sea, so when we the whole body of the robot is in the sea, the <br>
the flag for collision will be set<br>
To have a other surface since the robot is under water we have to create a mask between the collision of masks of the robot and the sea<br>
we we have collision we draw this surface on the robot so it seems like the robot is under water.<br>

<h4>Lava</h4>
we check a area for the collision of the robot with the lava, if we have a collision with 200 set bits, the robot would be slower<br>
if the robot is complately in the lava it would be more slower.<br>

<h4> Wall </h4>
the check of the collision between a wall mask and the robot is more complicated because we want to implement a realistic collision.<br>
To do that we have to know exactly which corner of the robot is colliding with the wall. So we create 4 surfaces of the 4 corner and build<br>
masks of it.<br>

<img src="../images/tank_player/collision_check/bottom_right.png" width="150" height="200">
<br>
now we just have to know where the wall is and what the current angle is so we can create a realistic collision.

<h3>Better movement and collision</h3>
We smoothed out the movement motions and added collision detection. <br>
Depending on the material of the tile the player collides with they are either slowed or bounced back <br>
(which is minimal for stone but expandable for different materials in the future) <br>

<h3>Enemies</h3>
Right now there is a static robot which shoots periodically <br>
and a patroling robot which stops and shoots if it detects the player in front of it <br>

<h2>Possible Outlook</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More 'intelligent' enemies, e.g. bosses</li>
    <li>More diverse levels with higher difficulties</li>
    <li>Scoreboard or story progression</li>
    <li>Custom images/animations for different robots and projectiles</li>
    <li>Add collectable items</li>
    <li>Local multiplayer</li>
</ul>
