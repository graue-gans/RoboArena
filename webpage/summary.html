<h2>Project Summary</h2>

Since the split we started our game from scratch. <br>
<br>
So we began with reimplementing what we already had before (<a href="../index.html">see weekly reports</a>) <br>
Then the idea was to create a kind of rogue-like platform survival game but first we had to finish some more basics we had not done yet <br>
<br>
<h3>Tiles</h3>
Since we did not yet do any work on visuals we started with creating three basic tiles <br>

<br>
and created a map editor for editing the underlying csv files ingame <br>
<img src="map_editor.gif" width="600" height="611">

<h3>Better movement and collision</h3>
We smoothed out the movement motions and added collision detection. <br>
Depending on the material of the tile the player collides with they are either slowed or bounced back <br>
(which is minimal for stone but expandable for different materials in the future) <br>

<h3>Enemies</h3>
Right now there is a static robot which shoots periodically <br>
and a patroling robot which stops and shoots if it detects the player in front of it <br>

<h2>Possible Outlook</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More 'intelligent' enemies, e.g. bosses</li>
    <li>More diverse levels with higher difficulties</li>
    <li>Scoreboard or story progression</li>
    <li>Custom images/animations for different robots and projectiles</li>
    <li>Add collectable items</li>
    <li>Local multiplayer</li>
</ul>
