<h2>Project Summary</h2>

Since the split we started our game from scratch. <br>
<br>
So we began with reimplementing what we already had before (<a href="../index.html">see weekly reports</a>) <br>
Then the idea was to create a kind of rogue-like platform survival game but first we had to finish some more basics we had not done yet <br>
<br>
<h3>Tiles</h3>
Since we did not yet do any work on visuals we started with creating three basic tiles, adding water and sand at a later point<br>

<br>
<h2>How to save and load the background and render it</h2>
We use a .csv file that contains integers each refering to a a specific tile, which then is loaded into our background matrix.<br>
This background is then used to draw the tiles at their given position when rendering the screen.<br>
<br>

<h2>Main Menu</h2>
You can click on play to play the game, click on map to edit your current or create a new map or click on exit to quit the game. <br>
When choosing to play you are prompted to choose a weather. <br> 
To go back to the menu press the esc-key at any time.

<h2>Custom Background</h2>
We implemented a map editor for editing the underlying csv files ingame.<br>
While at first this was a feature created for ourselves to facilitate building more interesting maps we kept it as a feature. <br>

<br>
<h2>pausing/unpausing</h2>
You can pause the game by pressing "f" and unpause the game by pressing "space". You are also abble to leave the game and go to the manu<br>
by pressing "escape"

<h2>Collision</h2>
<h4>How do we check for collisions?</h4>
To effectivly collide with different objects we create masks of all surfaces which we want to check collisions with.
<h4>Tile Masks</h4>
We need a surface with every tiles which we want to check collisions with, at first we need a transparent screen <br>
since we have it we have to blit the tiles on this screen, now we just have to build a surface from this screen and make a mask from it<br>
we do this process for every tile type in each iteration in the game loop.<br>
A mask has exactly as many pixels as the surface but the every pixel can just be transparent(0) or none-transparent(1).

<h4>Robot Mask</h4>
To build a mask for the robots and projectiles we create one from its surface.<br>
<h4>Collision Check</h4>
To check for the collision we can check if there is an overlap between the <br>
transparent pixels of two masks. We can also check for the area (overlap) of the collision so we know how many bits<br>
are colliding which is usefull when checking if you are completely submerged inside water for example.<br>

<h4>Sea</h4>
We check the area of the collision of the robot with the sea, so when we the whole robot is submerged, the <br>
flag for collision is set so we can use this flag to do the robot slower or any other functionality<br>

To be able to dive the car in the sea, we have to change the surface when there is collision between both masks. They way we do this is we <br>
take the overlap mask(set pixels) and build a surface of it then we blit it on the screen with the same position as the robot with different color.

<br>

<h4>Lava</h4>
We check the area of collision of the robot with the lava, if we have a collision with 200 set bits the robot is slowed down<br>
If the robot is completely inside the lave its slowed down even more.<br>

<h4> Wall </h4>
The check of the collision between a wall mask and the robot is more complicated because we want to implement a realistic collision.<br>
To do that we have to know exactly which corner of the robot is colliding with the wall. So we create surfaces for each corner and build<br>
masks of them.<br>

<img src="../images/tank_player/collision_check/top_right.png" width="150" height="200">
<br>
<img src="../images/tank_player/collision_check/bottom_left.png" width="150" height="200">
<img src="../images/tank_player/collision_check/bottom_right.png" width="150" height="200">
<br>
Now we just have to know where the wall is and in which direction the robot is facing so we can create a realistic collision.

<h3>Enemies </h3>
We implemented 3 types of enemies:
<ul>
    <li>A static robot that has a fixed position and angle and shoots periodically</li>
    <li>A patroling robot that moves in a straight path between two set borders. <br>
        If it detects the player in front of it stops and shoots at the players position</li>
    <li>A boss robot that follows you around hunting you down. <br>
        We used A* algorithm to calculate the shortest path between the boss and player. <br>
        While wall tiles are set as fixed borders, every other tile has a specific weight <br>
        associated with it. So if there is no other possibility the boss will also go <br>
        through lava to catch you!</li>
</ul>
<img src="game.gif" width="600" height="611"><br>
Naturally with robot enemies there come projectiles flying at you. <br>
Both the player (by pressing the f-key) and the enemies can shoot lava bullets at each other. <br>

<h3>life</h3>
Every robot has a certain number of lives.
<br>
<img src="life.png" width="600" height="611">
<br>
 Player robot has 10, static robot has 1, patroling robot 3 and the boss robot has 5. Any hit does 1 damage<br>
except the boss robot (it does 2 damage). And one damage destroys one life. when a robot has 0 lives it dies and disappears<br>
<img src="killing.gif" width="600" height="611">

<h2>Winning/Losing</h2>
when you have 0 lives you will lose the game and wenn you kill the boss robot you will win the game. Its eayser to win the game <br>
when you start killing other robots first.

<h2>Outlook</h2>
<ul>
    <li>More diverse levels with higher difficulties</li>
    <li>Tweaking maximum velocities and accerleration for player and enemies</li>
    <li>Scoreboard or story progression</li>
    <li>Transform the map builder into a level designer where you can <br>
        also place robots on the map for custom levels</li>
    <li>Custom images/animations for different robots and projectiles</li>
    <li>Add collectable items</li>
    <li>Local multiplayer</li>
</ul>
