<h2>Report Week 3</h2>
<p>This week we had to sketch out the first instances of our game.</p>
<p>It will be a top view game where the player controls a robot, who can walk in
    four directions and shot forward.</p>
<img src="Robots.png">
<p>There will be enemies which will walk around (randomly) and shot towards the
    player. More will appear over time</p>
<p>If one is hit it will lose HP.
    The score will rise by time or per enemy killed.
</p>
<p>On higher difficultys there will appear more enemies and they will do more
    damage.
